# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
This is an analysis of Kickstarter campaigns to help a decision makers decide on optimal setup for a new campaign.
### Purpose
To help a decision makers decide on optimal setup for a new campaign.
## Analysis and Challenges
This Analysis has shown that there was a great number of successful campaigns overall and that most had goals that did not exceed $4000. 
Louise would be well served to set a moderate campaign goal and would therefore have a good chance of success. 
Most of the failed kickstarters where those with hefty goals and therefore did not garner enough pledges.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The chart below shows some of the Months with a higher success rate:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This next one shows the Parent Compay Outcomes:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Based on these statistics, we can determine the following:

The mean of each distribution is around the 3rd quartile, so the data follows similar distributions in each subset.
The standard deviations are larger than the mean, which means everything below the mean is considered "close" to the center.
Some large values are driving all of these distributions. The standard deviations are all roughly twice the IQR in each distribution, except in the failed Kickstarters, where the standard deviation is closer to three times the IQR. There must be some failed Kickstarters with really high goals!
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The campaign would be successful if setup during the months of May, June, July
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The goals would need to be set at under $4000
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The pledges can be a limiting factor
